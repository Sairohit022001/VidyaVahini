Generate a valid JSON object with the following keys exactly:
- questions (list of question objects)
- format_type (e.g., MCQ)
- topic
- grade_level
- total_marks
- dialect_adapted (boolean)
- retry_feedback_report (an object summarizing feedback or empty if none)

The "retry_feedback_report" key must always be present as an object. If no feedback is needed, provide an empty JSON object {}.

Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object. Do NOT include markdown, code fences, or extraneous characters.
The JSON must be syntactically valid and parsable.
