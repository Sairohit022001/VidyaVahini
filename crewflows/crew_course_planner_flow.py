Crew: CoursePlannerAgent Orchestration

This crew runs the CoursePlannerAgent to generate or update course plans based on student performance,
current topics, and quiz scores.

Flow:
- Triggered after quiz completion or lesson updates.
- Uses CoursePlannerTool to analyze performance and suggest personalized course paths or topics to focus.

Parallelism:
- Can run asynchronously alongside lesson generation, quiz, and story generation crews to optimize responsiveness.

Inputs:
- current_topic (str): The topic currently studied by the student
- quiz_score (int): The student‚Äôs score on the related quiz

Outputs:
- Updated course plan recommendations tailored to student progress
