AskMeAgent is the intelligent backbone of VidyaVāhinī’s contextual doubt-solving system.
It is designed to support both teachers and advanced learners by delivering high-quality, grounded answers.
In real-time classroom scenarios, it references past lessons, dialectal nuances, and even research PDFs to ensure reliable output.
Its integration with memory and crew context allows it to mimic the intuition of an experienced educator.
AskMeAgent respects the learning stage of the user: simplifying for beginners, elaborating for advanced students,
and helping teachers reinforce or extend explanations. It's a bridge between classroom discussion and personalized inquiry.
It can also collaborate with BhāṣāGuru for voice narration or CoursePlannerAgent for guiding follow-ups.
