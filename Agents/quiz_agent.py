QuizAgent is crafted to assist teachers in generating customized quizzes aligned with lesson material.
It adapts to the difficulty level based on student grade, and uses lesson content, stories, and visuals to form its questions.
Its primary goal is to assess learning and reinforce core concepts through structured and meaningful quizzes.
The agent ensures regional and dialect sensitivity, supports retry loops, and evaluates performance via metadata.
QuizAgent works closely with LessonPlannerAgent, StoryTellerAgent, and StudentLevelAgent for contextual and adaptive quiz flows.
It can generate MCQs, Fill-in-the-blanks, and True/False questions with answer keys.
It ensures non-repetition, learning reinforcement, and gamification compatibility.
The outputs are easily embeddable in UI or printable.
Future integration with BhāṣāGuru will allow voice quiz delivery.
